Language Paradigms

the meaning of the word 'paradigm', and we will enumerate the main programming paradigms, as we see them.

Programming technique
Related to an algorithmic idea for solving a particular class of problems
Examples: 'Divide and conquer' and 'program development by stepwise refinement'

Programming style
The way we express ourselves in a computer program
Related to elegance or lack of elegance

Programming culture
The totality of programming behavior, which often is tightly related to a family of programming languages
The sum of a main paradigm, programming styles, and certain programming techniques.

	
A main programming paradigm stems an idea within some basic discipline which is relevant for performing computations

Main programming paradigms
The imperative paradigm
The functional paradigm
The logical paradigm
The object-oriented paradigm

Other possible programming paradigms
The visual paradigm
One of the parallel paradigms
The constraint based paradigm


1.  Overview of the imperative paradigm

First do this and next do that
The 'first do this, next do that' is a short phrase which really in a nutshell describes the spirit of the imperative paradigm. The basic idea is the command, which has a measurable effect on the program state. The phrase also reflects that the order to the commands is important. 'First do that, then do this' would be different from 'first do this, then do that'.

In the itemized list below we describe the main properties of the imperative paradigm.


 
 

2.2.  Overview of the functional paradigm


We here introduce the functional paradigm at the same level as imperative programming was introduced in Section 2.1.

Functional programming is in many respects a simpler and more clean programming paradigm than the imperative one. The reason is that the paradigm originates from a purely mathematical discipline: the theory of functions. As described in Section 2.1, the imperative paradigm is rooted in the key technological ideas of the digital computer, which are more complicated, and less 'clean' than mathematical function theory.

Below we characterize the most important, overall properties of the functional programming paradigm. Needless to say, we will come back to most of them in the remaining chapters of this material.

Evaluate an expression and use the resulting value for something

Characteristics:
Discipline and idea
Mathematics and the theory of functions
The values produced are non-mutable
Impossible to change any constituent of a composite value
As a remedy, it is possible to make a revised copy of composite value
Atemporal
Time only plays a minor role compared to the imperative paradigm
Applicative
All computations are done by applying (calling) functions
The natural abstraction is the function
Abstracts a single expression to a function which can be evaluated as an expression
Functions are first class values
Functions are full-fledged data just like numbers, lists, ...
Fits well with computations driven by needs
Opens a new world of possibilities
 

2.3.  Overview of the logic paradigm


The logic paradigm is dramatically different from the other three main programming paradigms. The logic paradigm fits extremely well when applied in problem domains that deal with the extraction of knowledge from basic facts and relations. The logical paradigm seems less natural in the more general areas of computation.

Answer a question via search for a solution
Below we briefly characterize the main properties of the logic programming paradigm.


Characteristics:
Discipline and idea
Automatic proofs within artificial intelligence
Based on axioms, inference rules, and queries.
Program execution becomes a systematic search in a set of facts, making use of a set of inference rules
 

2.4.  Overview of the object-oriented paradigm


The object-oriented paradigm has gained great popularity in the recent decade. The primary and most direct reason is undoubtedly the strong support of encapsulation and the logical grouping of program aspects. These properties are very important when programs become larger and larger.

The underlying, and somewhat deeper reason to the success of the object-oriented paradigm is probably the conceptual anchoring of the paradigm. An object-oriented program is constructed with the outset in concepts, which are important in the problem domain of interest. In that way, all the necessary technicalities of programming come in second row.

Send messages between objects to simulate the temporal evolution of a set of real world phenomena
As for the other main programming paradigms, we will now describe the most important properties of object-oriented programming, seen as a school of thought in the area of computer programming.


Characteristics:
Discipline and idea
The theory of concepts, and models of human interaction with real world phenomena
Data as well as operations are encapsulated in objects
Information hiding is used to protect internal properties of an object
Objects interact by means of message passing
A metaphor for applying an operation on an object
In most object-oriented languages objects are grouped in classes
Objects in classes are similar enough to allow programming of the classes, as opposed to programming of the individual objects
Classes represent concepts whereas objects represent phenomena
Classes are organized in inheritance hierarchies
Provides for class extension or specialization
This ends the overview of the four main programming paradigms. From now on the main focus will be functional programming in Scheme, with special emphasis on examples drawn from the domain of web program development.
